I understand that there are copyright issues involved, but that kind of almost put me away from finishing the project.

This is definitely the most fun project I've made so far and the one I've learned by far the most, as I had to use both my brain and Google to fix whatever issue I ran into. I also like to think that I have my code organized pretty neatly, but I will leave that to the experts who might end up checking the project. I also plan to expand very much on the project, adding a backend with registration/login form, adding favorites and anything else that comes to my mind in the future.
