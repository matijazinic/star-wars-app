My name is Matija and I&#x27;m a 25 year old living in Croatia. I have started coding in React a couple of months ago and this is my first bigger project being done completely on my own. So far, I have done a couple of projects from FrontEnd Mentor (which you can see on my github page linked in footer).</p><p>Reason why I chose this particular API to create my solo project is very simple: I&#x27;m a huge Star Wars fan. Unfortunately, I found out pretty quickly that the API is a bit outdated and that none of the newer movies and other things are included. That, however, wasn&#x27;t that big of an issue since this is only a project to showcase React skills and not like a complete Wiki.</p><p>Much bigger issue (in my opinion) was the lack of pictures. I understand that there are copyright issues involved, but that kind of almost put me away from finishing the project. I have added a couple of my own pictures (for the cards on the homepage), however I couldn&#x27;t force myself to try and find a picture via Google for each character/ship/planet and anything else included in the project as that&#x27;s over 150 items in total. Bandwidth ain&#x27;t cheap!</p><p>That meant that I had to resort to alternatives, so I decided to use placeholder images and I also created a table view for each of the different pages. Pretty neat in my opinion. However, I couldn&#x27;t really find an alternative on each item&#x27;s (character, ship etc.) page, so placeholders were my best bet. I&#x27;m really not happy with how it looks as it would be much better if there are images of those items, but it is what it is. Maybe in the future!</p><p>Time to finish up this quick about section. This is definitely the most fun project I&#x27;ve made so far and the one I&#x27;ve learned by far the most, as I had to use both my brain and Google to fix whatever issue I ran into. I also like to think that I have my code organized pretty neatly, but I will leave that to the experts who might end up checking the project. I also plan to expand very much on the project, adding a backend with registration/login form, adding favorites and anything else that comes to my mind in the future. Who knows, maybe I even add those missing images :D.</p><p>Anyway, that&#x27;s all from me. If anyone&#x27;s actually reading this and you are interested in contacting me, you can click on my name in footer and you will be redirected to my GitHub page. You can then message me or add suggestions and anything else that comes to your mind. Have a great day!</p></div></div></div></main><footer class="bg-dark"><div class="py-4 text-center container">Created by<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/matijazinic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Matija Zinic</a>.
